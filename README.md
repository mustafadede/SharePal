Share your thoughts, interact with your followers and create lists to keep track of your favorite films and series. Make lists for your friends or suggest films and series to them. Just a tip: make sure to check the "Spoiler" button when posting. ü§ó

## ‚ú® Why you should use `SharePal` ?

1.  SharePal is designed only for film and series related content. Not a social media platform where you can share everything. Just films and series. üé¨

2.  No more spoilers! You can mark your posts as spoilers. So, your friends can decide whether to see your post or not. ü§´

3.  Say goodbye to the chaos of spending hours searching for the perfect film or series. View your friends' lists for personalized recommendations, or discover new types of content every day. üé•
